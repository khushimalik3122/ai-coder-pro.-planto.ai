## Research 

AI-Coder-Pro was developed to explore the integration of open, customizable LLMs (like Together AI's models) into developer workflows, with a focus on transparency, extensibility, and user privacy. Unlike proprietary tools, this extension allows users to select their own models and providers, and is designed for research and experimentation in code generation and multi-agent orchestration.
